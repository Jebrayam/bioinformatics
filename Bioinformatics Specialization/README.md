# Bioinformatics Specialization
- **PatternCount(data, pattern)**: Slide a window down *data*, check whether each k-mer substring of *data* matches *pattern*.
- **FrequentWords(data, k)**: Checks all k-mers appearing in a sequence and then computes how many time each k-mer appears in *data*.
- **ReverseComplement(pattern)**: Given a nucleotide p, we denote its complementary nucleotide as p*. The reverse complement of a string Pattern = p1 … pn is the string Patternrc = pn* … p1* formed by taking the complement of each nucleotide in Pattern, then reversing the resulting string.
- **PatternMatching(pattern, genome)**: Finds all occurrences of a pattern in a string.
- **ClumpFinding(genome, k-mer, L-window, t-times)**: Finds patterns forming clumps in a string.
- **PatternToNumber(pattern)**: Transforms a k-mer into an integer.
- **NumberToPattern(index, k)**: Transforms an integer between 0 and 4^k - 1 into a k-mer. 
- **ComputingFrequencies(Text, k)**: Generates a frequency array.
