- **PatternCount(data, pattern)**: Slide a window down *data*, check whether each k-mer substring of *data* matches *pattern*.
- **FrequentWords(data, k)**: Checks all k-mers appearing in a sequence and then computes how many time each k-mer appears in *data*.
- **ReverseComplement(pattern)**: Given a nucleotide p, we denote its complementary nucleotide as p*. The reverse complement of a string Pattern = p1 … pn is the string Patternrc = pn* … p1* formed by taking the complement of each nucleotide in Pattern, then reversing the resulting string.
